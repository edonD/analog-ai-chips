**Status:** working
**Progress:** Worker agent just started. Received full mission prompt with v7 context (commit b904fe8). Currently reading program_top.md, redesign.md, and searching for .spice files.
**Current task:** Initial codebase exploration — reading mission docs and existing design files
**Issues:** None yet. Worker is in "Percolating" (thinking) phase after initial file search.
**Guidance:** N/A — just started


### 2026-04-01 10:52 UTC
**Status:** working
**Progress:** Worker found a critical bug in error amp (00_error_amp/design.cir): XMbn_cs was sinking current from pb_cs with no source → pb_cs=0V → XMcs_n OFF → ea_out stuck at BVDD → pass device gate=BVDD, Vsg=0 → pass device OFF → PVDD=1.92V at no-load. Worker removed XMbn_cs intermediate mirror and connected XMcs_n gate directly to ibias_en with m=50 for 50× current mirror. Re-running ngspice simulation (tb_v7_dc_startup.spice) to verify fix.
**Current task:** Waiting for ngspice DC startup simulation results after error amp bias fix. Shows "Churning" for ~6 minutes — likely still in simulation.
**Issues:** None — worker correctly diagnosed the bias bug and applied a reasonable fix. The m=50 multiplier on XMcs_n gives 50µA from 1µA ibias_en reference.
**Guidance:** N/A — worker is making good progress debugging autonomously
